Extensive front-end software engineering experience in the last few years.\
\
I have been building a BI product from ground up using the latest JS framework (Angularjs) and have never been more excited about the future of UI/UX development for the web. Prior to that, I built a feature rich and snappy web experience using google closure at Zoosk which enjoyed explosive growth during the time. During my tenure at Yahoo!, I developed 2 high-impact products at Yahoo! Finance, namely the streaming quotes and finance autocomplete.\
\
My bottomline ability is creative problem solving, architecting complex products from ground up. Having grown up hearing impaired with a passion for continuous learning, I am up for any engineering challenge in building reliable, responsive and delightful user experiences.\

- Architected two high-impact products for the Yahoo! Finance website - the streaming quotes and finance autocomplete.\
	-- Prototyped and implemented the first production frontend code for streaming quote data in browser, closely working with another engineer integrating a comet-based streaming model. Also converted the static portfolios to be streaming as well.\
	-- Implemented the finance autocomplete feature from ground up, using ternary search tree for superfast webservice performance.\
\
- Developed multiple features and modules for the Global Finance project which drives multiple localized versions of the finance site powered by one codebase.\
\
- Developed and maintained a wide variety of internal components and webservice. The complex finance architecture made every small project an exercise of creative problem solving and making the best use of time and resources.\
\
- Contributed a few prototypes and ideas in the internal hack days. They include streaming charts on iphone, portfolio charts, and a couple of productivity tools like website comparator and context-aware bash shell autocomplete.\
\
Technology/processes: Agile scrum, c/c++, javascript, yui, ajax, html/css, perl, php, xslt, continuous integration with hudson\

\fs28 \cf0 Outside work I keep myself involved in side projects to learn new technologies. I have helped a friend develop a virtual classroom product on top of a few open source projects. I was also a founding engineer of a stealth mode startup that worked on NLP based pattern extraction from current trending topics.\

My personal coding projects are in http://github.com/jdutta.\

\b\fs36 \cf0 Background
\b0\fs20 \

\fs28 \
My turn-ons are great designs that solve a common problem elegantly and frugally. Do-It-Yourself projects are a passion from an early age, being raised in a very small town in India. I learnt to design and build my own gadgets out of available recycled materials. The creative pursuits continue to this day, in many different forms. Programming and technology is something I breathe everyday for the infinite possibilities of what can be done with them.\
\
Making sense of the world around me and how to put my skills to optimum use is my mantra of life.\
